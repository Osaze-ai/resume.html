		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
			My objective is to create and maintain optimally functional websites and
			applications using clean code to improve user accessibility and
			experiences. From a very early age I've been a problem solver. I was that
			kid who would take apart anything to see how it worked, and then try to
			put it back together to make it even better.
		</p>

		<p>
			As you can imagine this made my parents think twice about buying me new
			toys and gadgets. This tinkering trait has served me well in my career as
			a junior web developer with 1+ years experience, and a track record of
			meaningful contributions in JavaScript to large scale commercial projects.
		</p>

		<p>
			Known as an influential team player and swift learner, adept at
			cultivating positive relationships. Creative problem solver, experienced
			in creating high-quality clean, scalable, and reusable code with proven
			success in developing innovative solutions for android applications and
			client-server platforms.
